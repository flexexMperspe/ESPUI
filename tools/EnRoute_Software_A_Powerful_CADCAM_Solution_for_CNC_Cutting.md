In this article, we will show you some examples of how EnRoute Software can help you create amazing projects with your CNC machine. We will also share some tips and tricks to get the most out of EnRoute Software.
 
## Example 1: Woodworking
 
One of the most popular applications of EnRoute Software is woodworking. Whether you are making furniture, cabinets, doors, signs or art pieces, EnRoute Software can help you design and cut your wood projects with precision and efficiency.
 
For example, let's say you want to make a wooden sign with a carved text and a textured background. Here are the steps you would follow in EnRoute Software:

1. Create a new file and set the dimensions and resolution of your project.
2. Use the text tool to type your text and choose a font and size.
3. Use the v-carve toolpath to generate a toolpath for your text. You can adjust the depth, angle and spacing of your cuts.
4. Use the texture toolpath to generate a toolpath for your background. You can choose from different patterns and styles or create your own custom texture.
5. Use the simulation mode to preview your toolpaths and check for any errors or overlaps.
6. Save your file and send it to your CNC machine.

Here is an example of how your sign would look like:

As you can see, EnRoute Software allows you to create stunning wood projects with ease and creativity. You can also use EnRoute Software to create other types of wood projects, such as inlays, reliefs, joinery, moldings and more.
 
## Example 2: Metal Fabrication
 
Another common application of EnRoute Software is metal fabrication. Whether you are cutting sheet metal, pipes, tubes or plates, EnRoute Software can help you design and cut your metal projects with accuracy and speed.
 
For example, let's say you want to make a metal sculpture with a complex shape and a smooth surface. Here are the steps you would follow in EnRoute Software:

1. Create a new file and set the dimensions and resolution of your project.
2. Use the import tool to import a 3D model of your sculpture from another software or scan it from a physical object.
3. Use the mesh tool to convert your 3D model into a mesh that can be edited in EnRoute Software.
4. Use the smooth tool to smooth out any rough edges or bumps on your mesh.
5. Use the contour toolpath to generate a toolpath for your sculpture. You can adjust the cutting direction, stepover, feed rate and spindle speed.
6. Use the simulation mode to preview your toolpath and check for any errors or collisions.
7. Save your file and send it to your CNC machine.

Here is an example of how your sculpture would look like:
